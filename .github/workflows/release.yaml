      #
      # I tried to rely on vcpkg but this didn't work:
      #   - run: |
      #       vcpkg install libxml2:arm64-windows
      #       vcpkg install libxslt:arm64-windows
      #       vcpkg integrate install
      #
      # Another possibility would be to install the pre-built binaries available
      # at: https://github.com/lxml/libxml2-win-binaries
      #
      # But all build attempts ends up with:
      #   C:\Users\RUNNER~1\AppData\Local\Temp\xmlXPathInit8xwj7_4f.c(1): fatal

      #   Could not find function xmlXPathInit in library libxml2. Is libxml2
