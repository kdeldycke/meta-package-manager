## How-to add a new package manager

For now the easiest way to have new package managers supported is to:

1. Fork the project.
1. Identify an already implemented package manager that is similar to the new
   one youâ€™d like to add.
1. Duplicate its already existing definition file in the
   {gh}`/managers subfolder <tree/main/meta_package_manager/managers>`.
1. Adapt the new file to the particularities of the new package manager. Read
   the {doc}`/falsehoods` to anticipate edge-cases.
1. Fix the code until the unittests passes. Most of all metadata and format
   constraints for new managers are enforced in the unittest suite. See the
   {doc}`/development` page for more technical details.
1. Send a PR.
