# Use-cases

A collection of user’s problems and how `mpm` solves them.

## Keep system secure

A recent
[study shows that 70% of vulnerabilities lies in outdated libraries](https://developers.slashdot.org/story/20/05/23/2330244/open-source-security-report-finds-library-induced-flaws-in-70-of-applications).
One of the key habits of security professionnals to keep a system secure
consist in having all software up to date.

`mpm` helps you upgrade all packages from all managers of a system with
one-liner:

```shell-session
$ mpm upgrade
Updating all outdated packages from brew...
==> Upgrading 4 outdated packages:
gnu-getopt 2.35.1 -> 2.35.2
rclone 1.51.0 -> 1.52.0
fd 8.1.0 -> 8.1.1
youtube-dl 2020.05.08 -> 2020.05.29
(...)
Updating all outdated packages from cask...
==> Upgrading 4 outdated packages:
balenaetcher 1.5.89 -> 1.5.94, libreoffice 6.4.3 -> 6.4.4
(...)
Updating all outdated packages from gem...
Updating openssl
(...)
Updating all outdated packages from npm...
+ npm@6.14.5
(...)
Updating all outdated packages from pip...
Successfully installed dephell-argparse-0.1.3
Successfully installed dephell-pythons-0.1.15
```

This is the primary use case of `mpm` and the first reason I built it.

## Extra features for your package managers

All package managers are not on-par between themselves. `mpm` is filling the
gap between managers and implement some missing features.

For instance,
[`pip` doesn’t can’t upgrade all outdated package](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/4551)
with a single command. `mpm` adds that missing feature:

```shell-session
$ mpm --pip upgrade
Updating all outdated packages from pip...
warning: pip doesn't seems to implement a full upgrade subcommand. Call
single-package upgrade CLI one by one.

```

Another example is the modest `opkg` package manager, only used by a
confidential audience. It is a bare project with only the basic primitives
implemented (`update`, `list`, …). Thanks to `mpm` it gains a free `search`
feature.

## Same package, multiple sources

You just learned of a new CLI you did not known about (`broot`) from a friend.
Back to your terminal, you can easely search for it across all package
repositories, then choose your preferred package manager to install it:

```shell-session
$ mpm search broot
╭────────────────┬───────┬───────────┬──────────────────╮
│ Package name   │ ID    │ Manager   │ Latest version   │
├────────────────┼───────┼───────────┼──────────────────┤
│ broot          │ broot │ brew      │ 0.1.0            │
│ broot          │ broot │ pip       │ 0.1.1            │
╰────────────────┴───────┴───────────┴──────────────────╯
2 packages total (brew: 1, pip: 1, cask: 0, gem: 0, mas: 0, npm: 0).
```

```shell-session
$ mpm --brew install broot
Package manager order: brew
Install broot package from brew...
(...)
🍺  /usr/local/Cellar/broot/0.13.6: 8 files, 3.5MB
```

Thanks to `mpm` we were able to choose quickly the origin from which we sourced
`broot` to get the latest version. No need to track down the CLI on Github and
read the documentation (if it even exists).

## Deduplicate packages

Use the `search` command to hunt down packages that were installed via multiple
managers.

One exemple I had on my machine, in which `httpie` was both installed by the
way of `brew` and `pip`:

```shell-session
$ mpm installed | grep httpie
│ httpie  │ httpie  │ brew  │ 2.1.0  │
│ httpie  │ httpie  │ pip   │ 2.1.0  │
```

Now you can easely remove one of them, and no longer have to think hard about
which is which.

```shell-session
$ python -m pip uninstall httpie
Found existing installation: httpie 2.1.0
Uninstalling httpie-2.1.0:
  Would remove:
    /usr/local/bin/http
    /usr/local/bin/https
    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/httpie-2.1.0.dist-info/*
    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/httpie/*
Proceed (y/n)? y
  Successfully uninstalled httpie-2.1.0
```

```{todo}
Add arguments to `installed` command, or an `--installed` boolean flag to `search` so we can reduce the searched packages to those installed.
```

## Backup installed packages

You maintain a repository of `dotfiles`. This helps you spawn up a highly
customized working environment in a couple of hours. New job? New machine?
Easy: run your dotfiles, get a coffe, come back with everything perfectly in
place to start an extremely productive hacking session. But maintaining
`dotfiles` is a pain.

`mpm` allows you to dump the whole list of packages installed on your machine:

```shell-session
$ mpm backup ./packages.toml
Backup package list to ./packages.toml
Dumping packages from brew...
Dumping packages from cask...
Dumping packages from gem...
Dumping packages from mas...
Dumping packages from npm...
Dumping packages from pip...
1109 packages total (npm: 659, brew: 229, pip: 115, gem: 49, cask: 48, mas: 9).
```

```shell-session
$ head ./packages.toml
# Generated by mpm 4.7.0.
# Timestamp: 2020-05-29T11:15:29.539863.

[brew]
ack = "3.3.1"
adns = "1.5.1"
aom = "1.0.0"
apr = "1.7.0"
apr-util = "1.6.1_3"
arss = "0.2.3"
(...)
```

## Get rid of Docker for lambda?

Some developers have a hard-time reproducing environment for lambda execution
onto their local machine. Most of devs use Docker to abstract their runtime
requirements. But Docker might be too big for some people.

`mpm` can be a lightweigh alternative to Docker here to abstract the runtime
from their execution environment.

## Switch systems

You used to work on macOS. Now you’d like to move to Linux. To reduce friction
during your migration, you can invotory all your installed packages with `mpm`,
then reinstall them on your new, bare OS.

1. Inventory all installed packages on macOS:

   ```shell-session
   $ mpm backup ./packages.toml
   ```

1. On your brand new Linux install, restore all packages with:

   ```shell-session
   $ mpm restore ./packages.toml
   ```

```{todo}
Implement a best matchig strategy, across package managers of different kinds.
```

## Support and fund open-source?

One future development direction might be to add a way to inventory all
components your using on your system and track down their preferred funding
platform like [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors),
[Liberapay](https://liberapay.com) or [Patreon](https://patreon.com). Then have
a way to fund all those.

Homebrew is already featuring
[some commands in that direction](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7900).
