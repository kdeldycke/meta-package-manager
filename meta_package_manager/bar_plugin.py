"""SwiftBar and Xbar plugin for Meta Package Manager (the {command}`mpm` CLI).

Set the update cycle to several hours. One notice a day is enough, and each
check uses many resources. A short cycle can also use up the GitHub API quota
that Homebrew needs.

Both hosts give the plugin options to the script as environment variables:

- [Xbar passes them](https://xbarapp.com/docs/2021/03/14/variables-in-xbar.html)
  from its settings UI to the script.

- SwiftBar does the same since `2.1.0` added support for `xbar.var`
  ([swiftbar/SwiftBar#472](https://github.com/swiftbar/SwiftBar/pull/472)).
